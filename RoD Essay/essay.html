        <h1 id="begin">Who Am I as a <br><span id="changeText"></span></h1>
        <p>This is the question I have been asking my self again, again and again ever since I took my first step in the field of the so-called <span class="underline">Design</span>...</p>
        
        <p>I am trying really hard to find an answer, I know what it could be but I am <span id="underline">Not</span> certain. There are so many words swimming in my brain, but they disappear in seconds before I can catch them. </p>
            
        <p>So I started to ask around my friends who I am, or user researching on myself... In their eyes, I am "<span id="changeText_friends"></span>"</p>

        <p>Ha! I think I find some answers from the outside that could represent  myself in some ways. They help to reflect a bit deeper, but at the same time,<span class="blur"> they are still Vague</span> and hard to tell WHO I really am as a designer.</p>

        <p class="light_off">To think about this question all over again.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Love</h2>
        <p>Being a human is the basis of being a designer, as a human being, I am the creature of love.</p>
        <p id="c_love">The love that passed through me, that brought me to the world... to the world where love is in the air, where the world is built upon.</p>
        <p>It was the love all human beings share that taught me what love is and how beautiful it could be.</p>
        <p>Love is abstract, intangible and beyond language. But it could be anything, anything that triggers the impulse inside us.</p>
        <p>I love what I love. I pour time into it, I practice, I spare efforts.  </p>
        <p>Design is one of those I love because I pour my love into doing design and it passes my love to others through the piece, just as what I am doing right now.</p>
        <p>What is the love in design then? I don't know, but I can assure you that what you see here, the background music, the colors, the typography and the white space... All these details are my love, the love that I feel, and the same love I want you to perceive as well.</p>
        <p class="underline">Doing design is my way of finding the beauty of love and passing Love to others...</p>

        <h2 class="title">Art and Technology</h2>
        <p>I heard about design since I was little, but I could Not really understand what it means. Not until I read <i>Steve Jobs</i> in 2011 where I was first introduced to Bauhaus and the saying <i>At the crossroads of Art and Technology</i></p>
        <p id="c_at">I was exposed to design every day before my entering the design field but I never realized it. At that time, design to me was mixed with art that I was shocked by the fact that design is different from art.</p>
        <p>There is one more dimension of technology that makes design different from art. Well, it is apparently wrong...but it was how I perceived what design was. Design is none of them but could be both of them.</p>
        <p>The purpose of doing design is either showing my artistic or technical talent, but I value both very much in design. Because I am not merely an algorithm that is fed by data, but I am an intelligent individual fed by love, culture, and human values.</p>
        <p>I will express my artistic talent in every piece of design I deal with, and I will keep updating my bio-algorithm to make sure that I am doing design for today and tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Look <i style='font-size: 32px' class='far'>&#xf0a7;</i> this is a very simple example...</p>

        <p class="underline">Doing design is also a way of expressing my taste in art and technology...</p>

        <h2 class="title">Exploration</h2>
        <p>I would regard my life as a dictionary for only one-word <i>exploration</i>, where the meaning and scope of it expands over time.</p>
        <p id="c_exp">I enjoy trying new things and explore what is unknown and exciting to me. I did it, some worked out, but some didn't.</p>
        <p>My first step started with building a table for myself with cardboard since I was little and then played around with mud, clay, concrete, wood, acrylic, metal, computer programs, laser cutting and 3D printer...Tools are getting more and more sophisticated, but now, I am turning back to paper, scissor and cardboard since I was in TU Delft.</p>
        <p>Well, the exploration does not stop at different ways of building stuff, but it is also about expanding the boundaries of my design field and culture.</p>
        <p>Exploration means being open and tolerant. It helps reduce my biases by stepping out of my comfort zone to other fields to understand things better. But at the same time it brought me the issue that I sometimes forgot the way to step back. I need to strike a balance for this. </p>
        <p>Well...</p>
        <p class="underline">Doing design itself is the process of exploring</p>

        <h2 class="title">The boundaries?</h2>
        <p>Designer nowadays seems to be omnipotent and the scope of doing design is much bigger than ever before as I have perceived. Sometimes, I feel I can do anything as a designer. But, is it solely an <span class="blur_w">illusion</span> or is it the unseen truth?</p>
        <p id="c_mu">That is the question I have been asking myself more, more often than those I have mentioned before. I don't think I will find an answer quickly but I will let it keep resonating in my mind.</p>
        <p>So, what are the boundaries that define me as a designer? or should there be any boundaries to limit me? I am still doubting about this, but one thing I am aware and clear is where I started, I started with my feeling of love towards the world and I want to contribute to our human society and nature in many ways that I think is right.</p>
        <p>I have to admit that this seems to be against the human-centric approach of doing design because I value too much what I see, I feel, and I think from my own perspective. I think this should be right but the question is What if they are all wrong?</p>
        <p>I don't know, not till I will know.</p>
        <p>As a designer, I am wondering the boundaries of what my design expertise lies. But as a human being, I am wondering where are the boundaries of being a designer or others. Sometimes, I feel that having the so-called designer title restrict my way of thinking and becoming more creative.</p>
        <p>Now, I am wondering another boundary between <span class="underline">me</span> as an individual and <span class="underline">us</span> the human society. I always believe that each individual within us matters because that is the minimum unit comprising us, but I feel less and less that personal thoughts or opinions are being valued in the way it should have been.</p>
        <p>What are the boundaries? I don't know, they are everywhere but they are nowhere.</p>
        <p class="underline">It is hard to tell where these boundaries are but I am certain that I can across... </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container btm">
        <p>I am not going to conclude who I am as a designer but I saw great changes of my view on design and the link to the outside world I had in mind 3 years ago when I reflected on myself as a designer with an essay named <i>The world in the eye of a designer.</i></p>
        <p class="c_end">3 years ago, I firmly believed in design as a way of solving problems creatively, and design as a strategy to tackle wicked social issues. Well, they are for sure the solid ground and I will always keep them in mind in my practices.</p>
        <p>While today, I am thinking more about myself, and values, in the name of love, art and technology, exploration and the boundaries. </p>
