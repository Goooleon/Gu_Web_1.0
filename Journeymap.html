            <div class="des"><p>I joined Flight Case 2019 last year as commissioner of publicty. We had a very busy schedule during this semaster that we have 2 meetings every week, we did case acquisition of compaines in Japan for up to 5 months, and we started Flight Course at the start of the 2nd Quarter. Flight Case consumes a lot of time from me, but it is worth it. In the end, our team had contracts with 4 great Japanese compaines and we will have great trip to Japan in the summer from 11th of July till 8th of August.</p></div>

            <div><p class="date">Feb 2019</p></div>
            <div class="des"><p>RCA London, as one of the most prestigious college in design and art, has attracted me a lot since my bechalors. I am very much interested in how art school especially RCA is doing design and their way of thinking because I once I received an offer to the program of Innovation Design Engineering (IDE) and I wonder if I made a right decision coming to TU Delft. It turned out to be either right or wrong, but just different ways of doing design. Students there complain a lot about school, but the design atmosphere there is much stronger than Delft and that is the only thinig I think I like better.</p></div>

            <div class="des"><p>RStarting from the end of March, I started looking for an internship both in the Netherlands and overseas. During that period, I had many interviews with both big companies and design consultancy. The result was fruitful that I received offers from <strong>Design Affairs</strong>, <strong>KLM</strong>, <strong>Alibaba</strong> and <strong> Siemens</strong>.<br><br>
                With Alibaba, the screening process is very long that 5 phone interviews were hosted and it lasted for 1 month.</p></div>

            <div><p class="date">May 2019</p></div>
            <div class="des"><p>Gary Hustwit is very much famous for his design documentaries. In this semester, I re-watched 2 documentaries of his, <i>Objectified</i> and <i>Helvetica</i>I have watched <i>Objectified</i> before this semester and it was super inspiring that covers from Indsutrial design to Interaction design, from crafts to the most sophisticated electronic devices. <br><br>
                I have been using Helvatica for a very long time and it is always my first option when choosing typo, well, mainly because it is neutral. As a legend typography, I am really interested in the story behind it. I did it, and I got to know what the lecture hall <strong>Wim Crouwel </strong> means! <br><br>Next coming up <i>Dieter Rams</i>, the new documentar by Gary Hustwit</p></div>

During this research phase, it was very intensed but are really look forwards to the results!</p></div>
